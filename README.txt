These are some little programs created for learning Prolog.

Prolog is a powerful logic progamming language, specially used in the AI domain. It's totally a different way of thinking compared to C/C++. Using prolog, what the programmers need to do is to describe well the question, instead of working on the algorithms.

Some comments are made in French, sorry for that :)
